## Validation not included

Note that the function exposed by this module assumes, but **does not check**, that its input conforms to the Contracted Object Property Layer Description schema. If you wish to catch errors that may arise from an inadvertent violation of that schema, you should check your input against the `copld-schema.json` file included with this module using any JSON Schema validator before passing it to this function.
